# Graphical Password Authentication

This repository serves as a comprehensive record of the work undertaken during the intense 36 Hour Smart India Hackathon 2022. It not only captures the initial ideas, designs, and implementations created during the event but also highlights the ongoing enhancements and refinements made to the project by diverse members of our group. Through collaborative efforts and iterative development, we have continuously improved the project, incorporating new features, optimizing performance, and refining user experiences. This repository stands as a testament to our dedication and ingenuity, showcasing the evolution of our project as we strive for excellence in innovation and problem-solving.

## What is Graphical Password Authentication?

A graphical password is a method of authentication that uses images or graphics, rather than alphanumeric characters, as a means of verifying a user's identity. Instead of typing a traditional password, users interact with images or graphical elements to authenticate themselves.

## How does it work?

Graphical Password Authentication works by presenting users with a set of images or graphical elements from which they need to select specific ones in a predefined order. This sequence of selections serves as their password. When a user attempts to authenticate, they are prompted to choose the correct images in the correct order. If the selections match the previously set password, the authentication is successful.

## Why use Graphical Password Authentication?

There are several advantages to using graphical passwords:

**Better Memorability:** People tend to remember images better than text, making graphical passwords potentially easier to remember than traditional passwords.

**Resistance to Shoulder Surfing:** Graphical passwords can be more resistant to shoulder surfing attacks, where an attacker tries to observe the password being entered, as users interact with images instead of typing characters.

**Enhanced User Experience:** Graphical passwords can provide a more engaging and user-friendly authentication experience, particularly for users who may struggle to remember complex text passwords.

**Potential for Increased Security:** Depending on the implementation, graphical passwords can offer a higher level of security compared to traditional text passwords, especially if they incorporate techniques to mitigate common attacks such as brute force or dictionary attacks.

**Accessibility:** Graphical passwords can be more accessible to users with certain disabilities, such as dyslexia, who may find it easier to interact with images than text.

Despite these advantages, graphical passwords also have some drawbacks, such as susceptibility to certain types of attacks, potential usability issues, and the need for effective image selection and management. As such, their use should be carefully considered and implemented in a secure and user-friendly manner.
